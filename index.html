        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black">I am passionate about creating and building software that is fun and modern.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black">I love to help people achieve their goals and create software for their own use.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black">As a first generation college student with a big interest in helping others achieve great things, I hope to help younger minority generations get access to STEM education and show them that it is possible to dream big and achieve the impossible.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black">With the way 2020 has presented itself, I have been able to ignite the flame in some of my past hobbies that I enjoy. Some include gaming, working out, reading, watching movies, and spending time with the family. Rocket League has been a great way that I have passed my time and has really helped staying social with new random online friends. With this being said, I have been able to party up online and create amazing highlights. I have recently started a youtube channel where I can post these highlights for fun. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black">You can check out my highlights here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVD8y8t79S3hpdzZak2eAA" target="_blank">Angel S</a>.</p>

          <p>Currently I have the oppurtunity to take an Entrepreneurial Senior class where we created an idea, formed a company, and created our initial pitch for future investers, businesses, etc..</p>
          <p>In a team of 5, we are currently creating a software that can revolutionize legal tech. We want to offer a software that will make it easier for patent prosecutors.</p>
          <p>Patent Penguin is a patent docketing solution that provides project tracking, case notifications, real-time USPTO status tracking, and document editing for patent prosecutors.</p>
          <p>We are in our pitch stage, and currently looking for outside criticism. If you know of anyone who can benefit from this software please have them reach out. Or if you have feedback, suggestions, or want more information, please feel free to <a href="mailto:patentpenguins@gmail.com?subject=Software">email us</a></p>

          <h1 align = "center">Simple Calculator using React.js</h1>
          <p>This was the first application I made. It was built using <u>React.js</u>, which is a Front-End, Javascript library.</p>
          <p>The main reason I used React.js, is because it is highly popular and I believe this was a great step into creating a fun and interactive UX/UI. There were a lot of hiccups in creating this app, it is far from perfect, there is still some logical statements that need to be fixed and added. *Improvements Pending*</p>

           <p>Some noticeable course work that inspired me to stay in a Computer Science route.</p>
           <p>Data Structures, Algorithms, Intro to Data Science, Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Introduction to Robotics, Software Development Methods & Tools,
             and Fundamentals of Human Computer Interaction
           </p>
           <p>These course taught me the basic ins and outs of computer programming, from Object Oriented Programming to Builing my first website. These course were very much hands on
           that every code built and processed was fun. Though at times it was hard and had a lot of SEG FAULTS (if you know what I mean), the oppurtunity
         to learn from the mistakes was fun.</p>

          <p align="center">First API Mini-Project</p>
          <p>This was a fun API project that used:<a href="http://api.open-notify.org/" target="_blank"> Open Notify API Server</a>.</p>
          <p>Libraries used:
              <li>Pandas as pd • requests as rq • json • from datetime import datetime</li></p>

          <p>I took in the response using requests.get() to find the current people in space and when the ISS will pass next.</p>

          <p>I aslo created a states.csv file that has the state abreviation, lat, and lon. This was used to pass as paramaters to our API. This allowed for outputing duration and risetime.
            Then I used the datetime library to conver the risetime timestamp format to datetime. This is used to be more comprehnesible to the public.</p>
          <p>Some potential updates:
            <ul>When a wrong abbreviation is entered, give a warning and ask to do it again.</ul>
            <ul>Add a loop so user can keep entering states after state has output information.</ul>

          <p>Our work is divided into two phases. In phase 1, we focus on analyzing our datasets, including forming word clouds and extracting features.
