          Currently I am a student at the College of Engineering and Applied Science located at
          CU Boulder.
          I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
          I will be graduating in May of 2021.
       <p> One of my favorite hobbies right now is playing <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Rocket League &trade;</a> with friends.</p>
       <p> Another hobby of mine is working out. I love to relieve stress by bench pressing, running, boxing, and just pushing the body to its limits. </p>
       <p> Movies also takes up some of my free time. I enjoy action, adventure, horror, and comedy. </p>
      <p> Travling is also a hobby of mine, due to this pandmic, I have not been able to do much of it. I have been fortunate enough to go to 10 countries: England, France, Belgium, Italy, The Vatican City, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Greece, and Germany.

             <p><li> This was one of my favorite classes that drew me into computer sciences.</li></p>
             <p><li> This course, I beleive, was the turning point to what I thought about how programming works. </li></p>
             <p><li> It showed me the basics of C++ and how it is used in OOP (object oriented programming).</li></p>
             <p><li> The best part about this class was our final project. As a team were we created a pizza game simulation. Our goal was to be able to find a way to
             deliver pizzas faster and more efficiently. We implemented Priority Queues, Stacks, Linked Lists, and Pointers.</li></p>

             <p><li> Another one of my favorite classes.</li></p>
             <p><li> This course was super exciting to do because aside from OOP, it was a fun experience learning the basics of HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. </li></p>
             <p><li> This class gave me the idea to create this website from scratch. (Definitely took some time)</li></p>
             <p><li> I took this course durring the summer of 2019 and it was very fast paced, nonetheless, it was a very exciting turning point for me.</li></p>
             <p><li> For this class We designed a website that was meant for Slam Poetry events. The idea and goal was for users to be able to see what
               competitions/events, related to Slam Poetry, will be going on at a café/bar near them. We also implemented the idea of users being able to
               sign up at a competition. Using MySQL as our database to be able to populate information such as Name, Email, and DOB from the user.
               During this experience I was in charge of handling Front End Development. I used the basics of HTML/CSS and Bootstrap methods to be
               able to make the website and interface. Creating the UX/UI was meant to bring quality content, simplicity, easy accessibility, and
               overall an enjoyable experience when visiting the website.</li></p>

             <p><li> This course was very different then alot of other courses I had taken. </li></p>
             <p><li> For this class, I did not do any coding, but nonetheless, did a lot of animating and modeling.</li></p>
             <p><li> I had to put my creativity to the test. The goal was to recreate a model of a real life architectural figure.</li></p>
             <p><li> Used modeling skills, textures and lighting. Lastly, animated a walkthrough of the indoor pool using Arnold Rendering</li></p>

             <p><li> This was the first application I made. It was built using <u>React.js</u>, which is a Front-End, Javascript library.</li></p>
             <p><li> The main reason I used React.js, is because it is highly popular and I believe this was a great step into creating a fun and interactive UX/UI.</li></p>
             <p><li> There were a lot of hiccups in creating this app, it is far from perfect, there is still some logical statements that need to be fixed and added. *Improvements Pending*</li></p>
